# Contributing

Sodium is still a small project. But, one of its goals is to include type-checking for
all the Semantic-UI and HTML controls, parameters, and other keywords. This is a big
manual effort and very error-prone. I will not be able to do it alone in any reasonable
amount of time.

Instead, I have started this project with the bare minimum needed for my immediate
work. I will add both more code/macrology and type definitions as I need them.
If you find this project useful but missing pieces, it should be easy for you to
add. I am very happy to receive PRs filling in everything that I'm missing. Even
small contributions are valuable and welcome.

To help keep things organized, it would be good to open an issue and get my feedback
before you create a PR. But, often, this is overkill. Use your own judgement and
common-sense. :-)

All the usual GitHub and open-source guidelines apply. I'll elaborate further in
this document someday (or submit a PR for this!) but you won't go far wrong if you
follow common rules like those listed in
<https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines> or
